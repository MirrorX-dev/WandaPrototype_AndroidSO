# WandaPrototype_AndroidSO
WandaPrototype its and Application for monitoring matchs &amp; events at Wanda Metropolitano. This version its specified for Android Platform.

The model of interaction with the application is common to all the software developed. 
It presents an interface based on the use of a single screen. For the time being, it has been decided to keep the application flowing on a single screen.
The interface design is remodelled by adapting the pattern of tones and shapes.
They are divided into several modules that allow the application information to be distributed without having to leave the screen.

The horizontal layout is implemented, which allows users to. Get a more comfortable view of the application. In cases of modern phones with elongated or very wide screens will take the application design for long format.
Work will be done on this interface to improve the usability and layout of the components.

Not long ago Android launched the dark mode for operating systems with the Android 10 version, letter Q. It allowed dark mode to be activated. While its function resulted in being able to save battery in those devices that use OLED screens, which are able to turn off their screen pixels and offer completely sharp colours (https://www.muycomputer.com/, 2019).
However, not all devices have OLED screens, so their use also offers advantages for users who use them at night or in dark places.
The development of this feature/compatibility was for the purpose of adapting the display to low-light environments. Winter days, late night match viewings, fans/neighbours coming to the stadium at night.
